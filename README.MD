### Admin user to check it functionalities

The server of this project has been hosted on Render, a free hosting service.
So it's important to point it out since being hosted on a free service, the back-end goes into a hibernation state after 15 minutes of inactivity. If a user tries to access the site and the back-end doesn't respond, it's necessary to wait for a moment as it will be "reinitializing" the services. This process can take up to 1 minute, depending on the server load on Render.

On the other hand, the front-end has been hosted on the Netlify platform, which allows hosting websites and web applications for free. For the front-end to work correctly, it's crucial that the back-end server is up and running and responding correctly. Otherwise, the front-end may display errors or unexpected behavior.
